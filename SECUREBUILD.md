## Automating Build on Singularituy-hub
* Have to install the securebuild version to test whether any of the instructions are failing. Get the commands from [github](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity-python/blob/master/singularity/build/scripts/singularity-prepare-instance.sh#L55)
* Use the isolated tag with the build command to simulate build environment on singularity-hub
